Joja Cola Expanded Mod by Objection777 / Alex Hiltunen


This is a module for the ConcernedApe's game "Stardew Valley", available on Steam.
I'm also using this as a basic portfolio item to showcase entry-level code skills, using skills
that were and were not taught during my education.


Requirements:
-SMAPI 4.0+
-Content Patcher


___________________________________________________
What does this mod do?

Adds in 35+ variants of Joja Cola into the game, with varied effects, designs, and lore.

Joja Cola variants are obtained from Cola Boxes and select vendors.

COLA BOXES

Cola Boxes are loot boxes obtained through various means, to include vendors, trash, and fishing. They are opened
by left clicking (previous/considering right click).

Cola Box variants:
-Basic (blue)
-Deluxe (gold)
-Premium (black)
-Imported (pink + green)

LOOT TABLES
Cola boxes each have their own loot table, found in the DLL for this mod.
-Basic spawns in low level, very basic sodas of normal flavors
-Deluxe can spawn any soda type, but is most likely to spawn powerful sodas
-Premium spawns powerful sodas, most likely
-Imported spawns sodas with weird, questionable, promotional, or designs foreign to Ferngill

CONSIDERATIONS:
-After Community Center Complete, Basic Boxes are no longer fishable above ground, replaced by Premium Boxes
-After Year 3, Imported Boxes can be found in regular fishing areas besides the mountain
-Import Boxes are the only types found on Ginger Island

SPECIAL SPAWNS:
-Imported boxes show up in trash cans on festival days, and in JojaMart/Krobus on the 28th of a month
